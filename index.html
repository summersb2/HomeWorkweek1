      <p>  Hello
          This has taken way longer than it should of but what ever, good things take time.  I'm not going to lie I definetly had to reference the solution a bit to work out a few bugs but I really do feel like Im getting a solid grasp on on writing code.  Even though it is super late because Im still getting used to a proper time managment schedule balancing schooll and work I feel like it was important for me to submit just to prove to myself that I could even build this site in the first place.</p> 
      
      <p>   I obviouslsy deserve the zero grade because I wasn't able to submit on time and I was able to reference the solution when I got stuck but In a weird way this struggle has definetly made me a stronger coder. Thanks for your patience gentlmen.  We can only go up from here.  </p>
